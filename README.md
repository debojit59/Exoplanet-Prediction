Our project focuses on classifying exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) using data from NASA's Kepler telescope. We employ a machine learning algorithm called Random Forest, which is adept at handling complex data patterns. The process involves preprocessing the data to make it suitable for analysis, training the algorithm on labeled examples to learn patterns indicative of different planet types, and then evaluating its performance on unseen data. Our goal is to develop a reliable model that can accurately categorize exoplanets based on their characteristics, aiding astronomers in identifying potential candidates for further study.
